LED strip is connected from the back side: addressable LED strips have a direction indicated by small arrows on the strip. The data line must be connected from the side where the arrow begins.<br>2. Incorrect GPIO set: Check in WLED settings whether the correct GPIO number is set as data output. The ready-to-use controllers usually have the correct settings printed either on the housing or on the circuit board.<br>3. LED strips with many LEDs connected and set, but the current limiter is still at the default value (850 mA). This often has the effect that LEDs flash briefly when the color changes and then go out immediately or light up very dimly. Check and, if necessary, correct the settings in WLED.<br>4. Wrong LED type is set. The correct LED type and the correct color sequence (RGB, BGR, etc.) must be set in WLED settings. Check that these settings are correct. You have to know the LED type, but you can simply try out the color sequence to see which is the right one. Special attention must be paid to the WS2814 LED strip, which must be set as SK6812 in the preferences.<br>5. Wiring is bad. Wiring must be done thoroughly. Loose contacts, cold solder joints, etc. must be avoided. You also need to be careful about the correct sizing of the cables for safety reasons.</p></div>

Sometimes, however, flickering can occur, e.g. the LEDs briefly flash white. Larger disruptions are also possible. With 12V or 24V LED strips, you usually cannot proceed without a level shifter. However, a level shifter is also expressly recommended for 5V LED strips, especially in productive use, to ensure trouble-free operation: a level shifter adapts the signal level of the microcontroller (3.3V) to the signal level of the LED strip (5V for all addressable LED types).<br>Professional WLED controllers always have an integrated level shifter.</p></div>

<div class="accordion-body" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>The control of the addressable LED strips runs with control signals, which have a basic frequency in the range of 800 kHz up to the single-digit MHz range (depending on the type). Accordingly, a level shifter must be fast enough to be able to pass on these signals cleanly. Fast types such as SN74AHCT125, SN74AHCT32 or SN74LVC2T45 are therefore recommended. Types like SN74HCT (i.e. without “A”) are a bit slow and OK for LED types like WS2812B, but can be too slow for some other LED types. In any case, ready-made bidirectional I2C level shifters built with transistors are not recommended. If necessary, these can be used, but you should then replace the pull-up resistor at the output (usually 10 kOhm) with a smaller one (<=1 kOhm).</p></div>

An ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontroller board without any additional components is sufficient for experimenting/trying it out.

<div class="accordion-body" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>Yes. You need a free digital input (GPIO) on the controller for this. Then you can connect a button between this input and ground (GND). If you click on the button, this GPIO is connected to ground at that moment and the controller registers this as a click. However, for this to happen, the button must be set correctly in the WLED preferences. First, a button must be configured. To do this, under Config->LED Preferences you have to assign the GPIO number to which the button is connected to a “Button” (e.g. you take “Button 1” first). You also have to define the button type. Normally it is a "Pushbutton". Then you can set what should happen when the button is clicked. To do this, go to Config->Time & Macros. Here in the "Button actions" area you can define up to three Presets for each button (enter Preset ID) that must be executed if a button is clicked briefly, long or double-clicked (therefore three columns). Of course, presets must have been created beforehand.</p></div>

For this, however, an infrared receiver must be connected to the WLED controller. Recommended types are TSOP38238 or KY-022. These receivers each have three pins: 3.3V, GND and IR data. IR data pin must be connected to a free GPIO pin. This GPIO must then be set as IR GPIO under "Config->LED Preferences". You also have to choose which infrared remote control you have. The following types are available: 24-key RGB, 24-key with CT, 40-key blue, 44-key RGB, 21-key RGB, 6-key black, 9-key red, JSON remote. The last type gives the opportunity to use any remote control. For this, the IR codes must be listed in a JSON file and then uploaded to the WLED.<br>2. From version WLED 14.0-beta3: An ESP-NOW compatible remote control. An example of this is the „WIZmote“ remote control. This is based on an ESP microcontroller. ESP-NOW can be activated in WLED settings. You have to enter the Hardware MAC address of the remote control. This is determined by clicking on any button on the remote control and copying the last received MAC address from the "Last Seen" field to the "Hardware MAC" field in WLED ESP-NOW settings (“Config->WiFi Setup”) and saving it with "Save". Advantages: no special receiver needs to be attached to the WLED controller and the signals are transmitted via radio network. Therefore there is no line of sight between the remote control and the WLED controller required, as is the case with an IR remote control. The 4 buttons "1"-"4" of the WIZmote remote control are linked to presets 1 to 4. The meaning of other keys is self-explanatory.</p></div>

The frequency of the control signal is fixed for these types. However, there are also addressable LED types that require a clock signal in addition to the data signal. With these types, a clock signal is transmitted from the controller to the LED strips. In this case two GPIOs are needed for the control and these must be set correctly in the WLED settings. The advantage is that the clock control enables faster data transfer from the controller to the LED strips. Faster effects can be run with a large number of LEDs.</p></div>

In this case the current cannot be fed in full only at the beginning of an LED strip. The problem is that because of the voltage drop within the strip, too little voltage arrives at the rear LEDs, so that they don't shine with full intensity or the colors are even distorted. It may therefore be necessary to supply LED strips with power from back side or even additionally at one or more points in between.

WLED Interface in the browser or WLED app only work if the controller and the PC/smartphone are in the same local network. Secure direct control via the Internet is not possible. However, it is possible to install a home automation system (requires special hardware), such as Home Assistant or IoBroker. These have the ability to control WLED controllers and at the same time provide the options to access the systems via the Internet. Another option is to set up a VPN connection. Some modern routers support this. Then you first connect to your home network via the Internet (via secure VPN technology) and then you can access WLED as usual. Another simple but limited option is to pair WLED Controller with Alexa device (like Amazon Echo) if you have one. Then you can control the controller via the Alexa app, but only change on and off state as well as the brightness. Of course, you could theoretically enable direct access from the Internet to the WLED controller in the router. However, this is extremely insecure because the data is not protected in any way and anyone can control your controller in this way.</p></div>

<div class="accordion-body" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>"Mapping" is the possibility of changing the order of the individual LEDs in the strip programmatically. Normally, all LEDs in a strip are connected in series (via the data line): 1->2->3->4->.... For some special effects or especially for 2D matrices you will often change the order without having to solder the whole strip together differently. For example, you can achieve that after each 3 LEDs the order of the LEDs is reversed, also by mapping, as if the logical order of the LEDs in the strip was like this: 1->2->3->6->5->4 ->7 ->8 ->9 ->12 ->11 ->10 etc.<br>Mapping is set via a JSON file, which must be named ledmap.json. You also need to prepare a special file in JSON format. For the example above, the content of this file will then look like this: {"map":[0,1,2,5,4,3,6,7,8,11,10,9]}. Please note that the LEDs are numbered starting with 0. You should also avoid using unnecessary spaces. You can omit individual LED positions by specifying -1 in their place.<br>Multiple maps can also be defined. For each map you then use a separate file called ledmapX.json, where X is the number (1, 2 etc.). Which map is then used can be specified in a preset with "ledmap":X,..., where X is the map number of the JSON file. In the simplest case, the content of the preset (API command) looks like this: {"on":true,"ledmap":1}. The ledmap.json file (even without a number), on the other hand, is not applied via preset, but always automatically when starting the controller.<br>The created ledmap.json file (or ledmapX.json files) must be uploaded to the WLED controller. To do this, open the address http://<YourWLEDIP>/edit in the browser, where <YourWLEDIP> is the IP address of your WLED controller. This is a tool to edit the configuration files on the WLED controller. In order for this page to be displayed correctly, your controller must be connected to the Internet, also already integrated into your WLAN network and no longer "only" available as a WLED-AP. You can also create the JSON files directly here. In order for the created or uploaded ledmap.json file to be applied, the controller must be restarted.</p></div>

You can also set what exactly needs to be synchronized: brightness, color, effects, segments, etc. In this way, several LED strips can show the same play of colors, even if they are connected to different WLED controllers for physical locations reasons, for example. The settings must be made in the "WLED broadcast" area under "Config->Sync Interfaces". Up to 8 groups can be defined. For example, you assign two controllers to one group and the other two to the other. Then the first two controllers are synchronized with each other (group 1) and the other two with each other (group 2), but not groups 1 and 2 with each other. On the main WLED user interface page there is a "Sync" button at the top that allows you to toggle WLED sync on and off.
