<div class="accordion-body" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>The most common mistakes are:<br>1. LED strip is connected from the back side: addressable LED strips have a direction indicated by small arrows on the strip. The data line must be connected from the side where the arrow begins.<br><img src="pictures/pic4.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>2. Incorrect GPIO set: Check in WLED settings whether the correct GPIO number is set as data output. The ready-to-use controllers usually have the correct settings printed either on the housing or on the circuit board.<br><img src="pictures/pic5.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>3. LED strips with many LEDs connected and set, but the current limiter is still at the default value (850 mA). This often has the effect that LEDs flash briefly when the color changes and then go out immediately or light up very dimly. Check and, if necessary, correct the settings in WLED.<br><img src="pictures/pic6.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>4. Wrong LED type is set. The correct LED type and the correct color sequence (RGB, BGR, etc.) must be set in WLED settings. Check that these settings are correct. You have to know the LED type, but you can simply try out the color sequence to see which is the right one. Special attention must be paid to the WS2814 LED strip, which must be set as SK6812 in the preferences.<br><img src="pictures/pic7.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>5. Wiring is bad. Wiring must be done thoroughly. Loose contacts, cold solder joints, etc. must be avoided. You also need to be careful about the correct sizing of the cables for safety reasons.</p></div>

<div class="accordion-body" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>The answer to this question depends on whether you just want to try WLED or want to make a reliably working and safe setup.<br>Trying out WLED: an ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontroller board (e.g. the so-called D1 mini or NodeMCU boards), a 5V power supply and a 5V LED strip (for starters, e.g. with 30-90 LEDs) is sufficient for this. WLED software is installed on the microcontroller (e.g. with this web-based <a href="https://wled-install.github.io" target=”_blank” rel="noopener">WLED Installer</a>).<br><img src="pictures/pic10.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>However, there are a few other things to keep in mind for a proper setup:<br>1. A level shifter is required for reliable data transmission from the controller to the LED strip (this is mandatory, especially with 12V or 24V LED strips). Then you have to solder something together or you can buy a professional ready-made WLED controller right away. Due to industrial production/assembly, these are also significantly more reliable than any hand-soldered structure.<br>2. For safety reasons, the correct cabling (length, cross-section, contacts) and the fuses to be integrated must be considered. Especially with LED strips, it gets more complicated because you need the so-called intermediate feeds. These must be planned and implemented correctly. <a href="https://wled-calculator.github.io" target=”_blank” rel="noopener">WLED Calculator</a> can be used as an starting point.<br>3. LED strips can get quite warm during operation and even overheat in the event of a fault. Again, for safety reasons, you have to protect the area around it: you shouldn't just lay LED strips like that, ideally you should integrate them into aluminum profiles or something similar. In normal operation, these act like a heat sink and thus extend the service life of the LEDs. In the event of a fault, they can protect the surroundings.<br><img src="pictures/pic11.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>4. To save energy while LEDs are off, you might integarte relays that switch the voltage of LEDs off completely.</p></div>

Some of the newer types like ESP32-C3, ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3 are experimentally supported, but productive use is not recommended yet because many bugs are suspected. In addition, the installation of these newer types is not that easy: there are several hardware variations/boards for which the SW must be specially compiled. It should also be mentioned that some ESP32-C3 boards (so-called C3 mini V1.0.0) are still being sold on the market where WLAN does not work properly.<br>It is also to mention that Sound Reactive WLED presently only supports ESP32 microcontrollers.

<div class="accordion-body" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>Many 5V LED strips can also be operated without a level shifter, especially if the wire between the controller and the LED strip is very short. Sometimes, however, flickering can occur, e.g. the LEDs briefly flash white. Larger disruptions are also possible. With 12V or 24V LED strips, you usually cannot proceed without a level shifter. However, a level shifter is also expressly recommended for 5V LED strips, especially in productive use, to ensure trouble-free operation: a level shifter adapts the signal level of the microcontroller (3.3V) to the signal level of the LED strip (5V for all addressable LED types).<br>Professional WLED controllers always have an integrated level shifter.</p></div>

<div class="accordion-body" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>The control of the addressable LED strips runs with control signals, which have a basic frequency in the range of 800 kHz up to the single-digit MHz range (depending on the type). Accordingly, a level shifter must be fast enough to be able to pass on these signals cleanly. Fast types such as SN74AHCT125, SN74AHCT32 or SN74LVC2T45 are therefore recommended. Types like SN74HCT (i.e. without “A”) are a bit slow and OK for LED types like WS2812B, but can be too slow for some other LED types. In any case, ready-made bidirectional I2C level shifters built with transistors are not recommended. If necessary, these can be used, but you should then replace the pull-up resistor at the output (usually 10 kOhm) with a smaller one (<=1 kOhm).<br>SN74AHCT125 LevelShifters are interconnected as follows:<br><img src="pictures/pic1.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br><img src="pictures/pic2.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>TXS0108 LevelShifter can also be used.

<div class="accordion-body" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>Yes. You need a free digital input (GPIO) on the controller for this. Then you can connect a button between this input and ground (GND), for example a momentary button. If you press down the button, this GPIO is connected to ground at that moment and the controller registers this as a click. However, for this to happen, the button must be set correctly in the WLED preferences. First, a button must be configured. To do this, under Config->LED Preferences you have to assign the GPIO number to which the button is connected to a “Button” (e.g. you take “Button 1” first). You also have to define the button type. For momentary button it is a "Pushbutton". Then you can set what should happen when the button is clicked. To do this, go to Config->Time & Macros. Here in the "Button actions" area you can define up to three Presets for each button (enter Preset ID) that must be executed if a button is pressed down briefly, long or double-clicked (therefore three columns). Of course, presets must have been created beforehand. For switch type button you can define what preset should be called when it switches on and off. The third setting (third column) does not hae any meaning in this case.<br><img src="pictures/pic12.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p></div>

<div class="accordion-body" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>Yes. There are two types of sensors:<br>1. With a possibility to adjust the sensitivity and the time delay. E.g. HC-SR501 type. These sensors can be connected to WLED and configured as a button.<br>2. Without the possibility to adjust the sensitivity and the time delay. E.g. HC-SR602 type. For these you have to compile WLED with a PIR Sensor UserMod.<br>Below we take a closer look at the HC-SR501 sensor:<br><img src="pictures/pic40.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>It has the following features:<br>1) Three pins for connection (GND, supply voltage 5…12 V, data signal with 3.3V level). Ground (GND) and the supply voltage can be connected directly to a power supply unit (5 V or 12 V). Data signal can be connected directly to a GPIO of an ESP8266 or ESP32 controller.<br>2) Jumper to switch between two modes. In position 1, when a movement is detected, a HIGH level (3.3V) is output on the data signal and the adjustable holding time is maintained. The data signal then goes back to LOW (0V), regardless of whether the movement is still present or not. If the movement continues, the data signal is switched back to HIGH after a blocking time of approx. 2.5 s. In position 2 it works similarly, but the data signal does not go to LOW as long as the movement is still present. Only when the movement no longer exists for an adjustable holding time, the data signal goes to LOW. So, position 2 is what you normally need.<br>3) Poti for setting the holding time. If this is turned counterclockwise as far as it will go, the holding time is approx. 3…5 s. In the middle position it is approx. 100 s and in the end position clockwise approx. 200 s.<br>4) Poti for adjusting the sensitivity. This is approx. 3 to 7 meters and is set lower if you turn the potentiometer clockwise.<br>In WLED SW you have two options how the sensor can be used:<br>Option 1) As a switch. You set a button under “Config->”LED Preferences” so that you can set the GPIO used for the data signal and select “Switch”. Then, when movement is detected, LEDs are switched on and go out after a holding time without movement.<br><img src="pictures/pic41.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>Option 2) As a PIR sensor, you can set two presets, one of which is activated when movement is detected, and the other when there is no more movement and the hold time has expired. This gives more flexibility to set what exactly should happen.<br><img src="pictures/pic42.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p></div>

The following types are available: 24-key RGB, 24-key with CT, 40-key blue, 44-key RGB, 21-key RGB, 6-key black, 9-key red, JSON remote. The last type gives the opportunity to use any remote control. For this, the IR codes must be listed in a JSON file and then uploaded to the WLED.<br><img src="pictures/pic13.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>2. Since WLED version 14.0-beta3: An ESP-NOW compatible remote control that uses radio network. An example of this is the „WIZmote“ remote control. This is based on an ESP microcontroller. ESP-NOW can be activated in WLED settings. You have to enter the Hardware MAC address of the remote control. This is determined by clicking on any button on the remote control and copying the last received MAC address from the "Last Seen" field to the "Hardware MAC" field in WLED ESP-NOW settings (“Config->WiFi Setup”) and saving it with "Save". Advantages: no special receiver needs to be attached to the WLED controller and the signals are transmitted via radio network. Therefore there is no line of sight between the remote control and the WLED controller required, as is the case with an IR remote control.<br><img src="pictures/pic14.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>The 4 buttons "1"-"4" of the WIZmote remote control are linked to presets 1 to 4. The meaning of other keys is self-explanatory. Attention: WIZmote needs two good quality AAA batteries to work properly. If the batteries are too weak, the correct signal will not be sent, even if the blue LED on the remote control lights up briefly, actually indicating signal transmission.</p></div>

There are sometimes new types coming onto the market that have a compatible control protocol.<br>However, WLED SW also supports the so-called analog LED strips, where all LEDs can only be controlled in the same way. These types need their own GPIO for each color. There are monochrome CCT, RGB, RGBW and RGBCCT strips. In addition, you not only need a microcontroller, but in any case some additional components such as MOSFETs (or commercially available RGB(W) LED aplifiers/repeaters/boosters).</p></div>

<div class="accordion-body" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>Analog LED strips not only need a microcontroller for control, but also some additional components such as MOSFETs.<br>A basic circuit diagram is shown here. You need one MOSFET and one GPIO per color. It should be noted that the MOSFETs are destroyed very quickly in the event of an overload. To reduce the risk of fire and prevent personal injury, additional circuit elements should be implemented to protect MOSFETs from overtemperature and overload. Depending on the type, fuses are too slow for this! You might consider using self-protected MOSFETs too or the entire MOSFET circuit can be packed into a fire-retardant (e.g. metallic) housing.<br><img src="pictures/pic29.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>The commercially available so-called RGB(W) LED amplifiers can also be used (also called repeaters/boosters). These typically include optocouplers and MOSFET circuitry (1 to 5 channels) and can be used, for example, as follows:<br><img src="pictures/pic44.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>Note that there is no GND connection between the controller and the amplifier. And this despite the fact that with all other WLED circuits it is always said that all GNDs must be connected to each other. This special feature is due to the fact that the inputs of the amplifier are galvanically decoupled from the outputs by optocouplers and the amplifier in this circuit is used slightly differently than its usual application.<br>You can connect the GPIOs directly (3.3V signal level) to the inputs of the amplifier or, if you use a ready-made WLED controller, you can also use the data outputs (of the level shifter, i.e. 5 V signal level). You can also use both at the same time:<br><img src="pictures/pic46.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>The amplifier shown in the picture is a cheap product. Its advantage is a metal case. However, its circuit is very simple:<br><img src="pictures/pic48.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>The simple structure means that the duty cycle of the PWM signal (the ratio between pulse and period duration) at the output is slightly distorted compared to the input. In many cases this is not critical, but it does result in the color composition of an RGB strip being slightly distorted. A significantly better (and slightly more expensive) version is described in <a href="https://files2.elv.com/public/14/1431/143195/Internet/143195_led_rgbw_repeater.pdf" target="_blank">this article (in German)</a>. Here the MOSFETs are controlled with push-pull drivers. This and some other measures in the circuit mean that the PWM signal is reproduced very accurately at the output.<br>There are also other variants on the market (e.g. MiBoxer RGBW 5-channel amplifier and similar ones) that enable more precise PWM reproduction, but require modification as shown in this picture:<br><img src="pictures/pic49.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>With this modification, this amplifier can be used, for example, as follows:<br><img src="pictures/pic51.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>The disadvantage of this type, however, is that it has a plastic housing. We have not investigated whether this plastic housing has a fire-retardant effect. Special safety precautions may therefore be necessary.<br>Three other types are shown below:<br><img src="pictures/pic52.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>The first type works quite well, the second only with modification of the resistors. The third type must under no circumstances be used for the application discussed here, as it has no galvanic isolation through optocouplers and an attempt to use it would lead to the destruction of the WLED controller.</p></div>

<div class="accordion-body" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>No. The value specified for the fuse is a so-called nominal value of the fuse. Their exact meaning varies slightly depending on the fuse type. Lets take a look at typical car fuses as an example. These are often used in WLED controllers because their voltage range (up to 32 V), suitability for DC currents and large selection of nominal values ​​(1 A to 40 A) make them particularly suitable for this application. These fuses are specified in the ISO 8820-3 standard and therefore always have a similar behavior, even if they are produced by different manufacturers. But be careful: cheap replicas can often be found on various sales platforms that do not meet this specification at all and therefore sometimes do not work properly. So, e.g. a 10A car fuse must be able to carry 110% of the nominal current, i.e. 11A, for at least 100 hours. It will still carry 135% of the nominal current (i.e. 13.5A) for 0.75s to 600 seconds before it melts and interrupts the current. It can carry twice of the nominal current (20A) for up to 5 s, at least for 0.15 s. And it will carry even 6 times of the nominal current (60 A) for up to 100 ms. This is valid for the nominal room temperature, at other temperatures the values can be different. If, for example, a 10A fuse can carry the current of 20A for up to 5s, other components that the fuse has to protect must also be able to carry this current without starting to burn during this time.</p></div>

In no case! Only a correctly selected and dimensioned fuse can interrupt the current in reasonable time perventing a fire in case of an overload or short circuit. The procedure of selecting fuse and wires is as follows:<br>1. You determine the operating current that must flow through the fuse. This is, for example, the maximum current that the LEDs consume.<br>2. Now you choose a fuse that has enough current carrying capability to carry the operating current over the lifetime without melting too early.<br>3. You choose connection cables, clamps, etc. Two aspects play a role here:<br>a) These components must not overheat at an operating current, but they must also be able to withstand all currents for as long as the fuse lets them through. If, for example, a 10A automotive mini fuse was selected for an operating current of 8A, the cables etc. must be able to carry 11 A permanently, 13.5 A for at least 600 s, 20 A for 5 seconds and even 60 A for 100 ms without catching a fire.<br>b) Connecting cables must not cause too high voltage drop too. Here it is not only the cross-section of the cable that is important, but also the length. The voltage drop can be the reason why you have to choose a significantly higher cross-section, although from point a) not such a high cable cross-section would be necessary.<br><a href="https://wled-calculator.github.io" target=”_blank” rel="noopener">WLED Calculator</a> provides a good starting point for such calculations.</p></div>

WLED Interface in the browser or WLED app only work if the controller and the PC/smartphone are in the same local network. Secure direct control via the Internet is not possible. However, it is possible to install a home automation system (requires special hardware), such as Home Assistant or IoBroker. These have the ability to control WLED controllers and at the same time provide the options to access the systems via the Internet. Another option is to set up a VPN connection. Some modern routers support this. Then you first connect to your home network via the Internet (via secure VPN technology) and then you can access WLED as usual. Another simple but limited option is to pair WLED Controller with Alexa device (like Amazon Echo) if you have one. Then you can control the controller via the Alexa app, but only change on and off state as well as the brightness. Of course, you could theoretically enable direct access from the Internet to the WLED controller in the router. However, this is extremely insecure because the data is not protected in any way and anyone can control your controller in this way.</p></div>

<div class="accordion-body" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"><div itemprop="text"><p>"Mapping" is the possibility of changing the order of the individual LEDs in the strip programmatically. Normally, all LEDs in a strip are connected in series (via the data line): 1->2->3->4->.... For some special effects or especially for 2D matrices you will often change the order without having to solder the whole strip together differently. For example, you can achieve that after each 3 LEDs the order of the LEDs is reversed, also by mapping, as if the logical order of the LEDs in the strip was like this: 1->2->3->6->5->4 ->7 ->8 ->9 ->12 ->11 ->10 etc.<br>Mapping is set via a JSON file, which must be named ledmap.json. You also need to prepare a special file in JSON format. For the example above, the content of this file will then look like this: {"map":[0,1,2,5,4,3,6,7,8,11,10,9]}. Please note that the LEDs are numbered starting with 0. You should also avoid using unnecessary spaces. You can omit individual LED positions by specifying -1 in their place.<br>Multiple maps can also be defined. For each map you then use a separate file called ledmapX.json, where X is the number (1, 2 etc.). Which map is then used can be specified in a preset with "ledmap":X,..., where X is the map number of the JSON file. In the simplest case, the content of the preset (API command) looks like this: {"on":true,"ledmap":1}. The ledmap.json file (even without a number), on the other hand, is not applied via preset, but always automatically when starting the controller.<br><img src="pictures/pic21.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>The created ledmap.json file (or ledmapX.json files) must be uploaded to the WLED controller. To do this, open the address http://YourWLEDIP/edit in the browser, where YourWLEDIP is the IP address of your WLED controller. This is a tool to edit the configuration files on the WLED controller. In order for this page to be displayed correctly, your controller must be connected to the Internet, also already integrated into your WLAN network and no longer "only" available as a WLED-AP. You can also create the JSON files directly here. In order for the created or uploaded ledmap.json file to be applied, the controller must be restarted.<br><img src="pictures/pic22.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p></div>

With the help of special API commands, which can also be set and saved as a preset, you can tell WLED in which color and brightness each individual pixel must be controlled. This is how an image can be displayed. If you want to manually convert an image into an API command, it would take a lot of time. However, there is a tool (PixelArt Converter) that helps. This means that anyone without WLED API knowledge can convert an image into an API command that is understood by WLED software. The source code of this tool can be found <a href="https://github.com/werkstrom/WLED-PixelArtConverter/" target="_blank">here</a> (ext. link). The following describes how it works. Essentially the whole thing consists of three steps:<br>1) Download WLED PixelArt Converter from GitHub to your PC and open it in a browser<br>2) Select image, set parameters and convert<br>3) Send the result (API command) to the WLED controller and, if necessary, save it as a preset.<br>To use the WLED PixelArt Converter you have to download the file <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/werkstrom/WLED-PixelArtConverter/main/pixart.htm" target="_blank"> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/werkstrom/WLED-PixelArtConverter/main/pixart.htm</a> (ext. link). When the file opens in the browser, right-click and then click "Save As" or "Save Page As". You can then open the saved file in the browser like a website:<br><img src="pictures/pic32.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>Here you have to enter the IP address of your own WLED controller under "Device IP/host name:". Then click on the "Download from cloud" icon. In the simplest case, if you have not defined any segments in WLED itself, the following appears under "Target segment id:": "undefined (index: 0)". Normally you should turn on "Scale image" and enter the dimension of the matrix (X/Y). Next, select the file with the image. The original image and the generated API command, immediately appears below<br><img src="pictures/pic33.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>as well as a preview of how LEDs are controlled:<br><img src="pictures/pic34.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>With "Send to device" you can send the image directly to the WLED controller. The result then looks like this:<br><img src="pictures/pic35.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>In order for the image to be permanently saved on the controller, you have to copy the API command and then save it as a preset in the WLED controller. To do this, create a new preset, give it a name, deselect the "use current state" option, insert the API command into the API input area ("API Command") and save the preset:<br><img src="pictures/pic36.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p></div>

In addition, the sensitivity can be quite poor, so that the whole thing only works at a higher volume of the signal.<br><img src="pictures/pic28.jpg" class="img-fluid"><br>In some cases you can do without this circuit and connect the GND of the audio source and an audio channel (left or right) directly to ESP (GND and analog input, e.g. A0 pin on the ESP8266 or GPIO36 on ESP32). This solution is rather quite dirty workaround and the quality might be better or worser.<br>2. Convert the analog line-out or headphone signal into a digital I2S signal with a special analog-to-I2S adapter (based on for example CirrusLogic CS5343 or TI PCM1808 or es7243 chips) and then connect it to the ESP32. In this case, the whole thing works like with a digital I2S microphone. The only difference to I2S microphone is that you need an extra PIN for MCLK (Master Clock) signal, which can only be generated by the ESP32 on GPIOs 0, 1 or 3. The other complication is that MCLK is a high frequency signal and must be wired extremly accurate and have short wires. For stability it is better to use ready-to-use controller with special Line-In to I2S adapter. The advantage is the best quality, good sensitivity and best sound reactive user experience.</p></div>

The WLED controller sometimes restarts every minute. A possible solution (but probably not 100%) is to deactivate UPnP in the FritzBox settings (under home network -> network -> network settings -> other settings -> transfer status information via UPnP). Another possible measure is to deactivate mDNS in WLED settings (delete mDNS name). The issue may also affect some UniFi devices with mesh activated.</p></div>
